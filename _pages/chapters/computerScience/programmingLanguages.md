## Which Programming Language Should I Learn to get Started With AR Development?

There are different technologies and engines available to create AR applications.
One option is the 3D engine Unity where application logic can be implemented in *C#* {% cite Ferr19b %}.

When using the Unreal Engine, implementations can be done in *C++* {% cite DSWh19 %}.
However, C++ is not an essential prerequisite for the Unreal Engine as it also provides a visual scripting language called *Blueprint* {% cite Ferr19c %}.

Another option is to develop AR experiences for the Web.
In this case, you should study Web technologies and the scripting language *JavaScript*.
