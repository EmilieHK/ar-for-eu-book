# Outline

In this tutorial, we will give an overview of spatial understanding, demonstrate the use of solvers and show how we can use these to control the way object behave in the playspace. There are four scenes, presented in this tutorial, each of them with a corresponding prefab that provides example applications for orbital, radial view, surface magnetism solvers and, finally, a combination of several solvers to build a catapult.
By the end of the tutorial, you should understand:
-        What solvers are
-        What types of solvers exist in the MRTK (2.3) API
-        The benefits and constraints of working with each type of solvers
-        How to implement solcers in a Unity project
