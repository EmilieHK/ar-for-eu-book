title: Performance Profiling & Optimization
---

We have added a new chapter about performance profiling and optimization.
The chapter highlights tools which can be used to monitor the performance of a Mixed Reality application.
This way, bottlenecks and performance draining routines can be identified.
Moreover, useful general-purpose optimization recommendations for Unity applications and Mixed Reality are presented.
Knowing the shown aspects before implementation can help building better Unity applications which run more stable.
