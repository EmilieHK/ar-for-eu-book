title: Book Redesign
---

{% include autoRelativePath.html %}

We have updated the visuals style of the book.
The starting page is now divided into sections and there is a navigation bar on the left.
Moreover, the book now has a cover image which is shown on the front page and in the preface.

<img src="{{pathToRoot}}/assets/images/Cover.png" alt="Book cover" width="50%" />

Another addition are icons which are displayed next to the chapters heading.
The icons build a visual design language by indicating which type of content can be found in each chapter:

| Icon | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| <img src="{{pathToRoot}}/assets/images/ReadingChapter.png" alt="Reading Chapter" width="100px"/> | This is a text chapter that conveys information about a topic |
| <img src="{{pathToRoot}}/assets/images/InfoBox.png" alt="Info Box" width="100px"/> | Icon for information boxes |
| <img src="{{pathToRoot}}/assets/images/KeyMessage.png" alt="Key Message" width="100px"/> | Highlights key messages |
| <img src="{{pathToRoot}}/assets/images/ProgrammingExercise.png" alt="Programming Exercise" width="100px"/> | This chapter contains an exercise/tutorial which invoves programming |
| <img src="{{pathToRoot}}/assets/images/Tutorial.png" alt="Tutorial" width="100px"/> | This is a hands-on tutorial but it does not contain programming parts |
